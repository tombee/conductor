# Building Workflows

Learn how to build production-ready AI workflows with Conductor.

---

## Overview

This section covers everything you need to build robust, maintainable workflows:

- **Core techniques** for workflow development
- **Best practices** for production use
- **Advanced patterns** for complex scenarios
- **Testing and debugging** strategies

---

## Workflow Development

### [Flow Control](flow-control.md)
Learn about conditional execution, parallel steps, and complex workflow patterns.

### [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
Build resilient workflows that gracefully handle failures and edge cases.

### [Testing](testing.md)
Strategies for validating workflows before deployment.

### [Debugging](debugging.md)
Troubleshoot issues and understand workflow execution.

---

## Advanced Topics

### [Profiles](profiles.md)
Configure multiple environments and execution profiles for your workflows.

### [Daemon Mode](daemon-mode.md)
Run Conductor as a long-lived service with API and webhook support.

### [Performance](performance.md)
Optimize workflow execution speed and reduce costs.

## Next Steps

Start with the fundamentals:

1. **[Flow Control](flow-control.md)** — Master conditionals and parallel execution
2. **[Error Handling](error-handling.md)** — Build resilient workflows
3. **[Testing](testing.md)** — Validate your workflows

Then explore advanced topics based on your needs.
