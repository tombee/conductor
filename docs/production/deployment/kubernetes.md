# Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes deployment guide will be available in a future release.

For the 0.0.1 release, we recommend using:
- [exe.dev deployment](../deployment.md#quick-start-exedev-recommended) for simple, managed hosting
- [Docker deployment](../deployment.md#docker) for containerized environments

If you need Kubernetes deployment now, please:
1. Use the Docker image: `ghcr.io/tombee/conductor:latest`
2. Create appropriate Kubernetes manifests for your cluster
3. Consider contributing your setup back to the project
