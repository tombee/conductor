  # Generate initial meal plan
  - id: draft
    type: llm
    model: balanced
    prompt: |
      Create a {{.days}}-day meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day.

      Requirements:
      - Variety in proteins, cuisines, and cooking methods
      - Reasonable prep times for weeknight cooking
      - Some ingredient overlap to reduce waste

      Format as a simple list by day.

  # Refinement loop
  - id: refine
    type: loop
    max_iterations: 3
    until: 'steps.critique.response contains "APPROVED"'
    steps:
      - id: critique
        type: llm
        model: balanced
        prompt: |
          Review this meal plan (iteration {{.loop.iteration}}):

          {{.steps.draft.response}}

          Evaluate against these criteria:
          1. Nutritional balance (proteins, vegetables, variety)
          2. Practical prep times
          3. Ingredient efficiency (some reuse across meals)
          4. Overall variety and appeal

          If the plan meets all criteria well, respond with exactly: APPROVED

          Otherwise, provide specific, actionable improvements needed.

      - id: improve
        type: llm
        model: balanced
        when: 'not (steps.critique.response contains "APPROVED")'
        prompt: |
          Improve this meal plan based on the feedback:

          CURRENT PLAN:
          {{.steps.draft.response}}

          FEEDBACK:
          {{.steps.critique.response}}

          Create an improved version addressing all feedback points.
